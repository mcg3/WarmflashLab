###Passage Cells with Dispase

	1.Warm up 2ml Dispase + 8ml DMEM F12 (store at 4*C good for 1 month).
	2.Remove media from a 2ml culture. 
	3.Add 1ml DMEM F12+Dispase. 
	4.Incubate 37*C aprox. 5min. (Cells will not detach, dispase just loosens the bonds). 
	5.Remove media and wash with 2ml mTeSR twice. 
	6.Add 1ml mTeSR.
	7.Scrap bottom to detach cells. Tilt plate and pipet up and down 10 times to break up the colonies.
	8.Transfer the desired amount of cells to a 15ml tube, complete to 2ml with mTeSR.  
	9.Remove excess geltrex from precoated dish. 
	10.Transfer the cells to the plate[Move the plate N-S, W-E; not circular]. Let it stand on bench for ~5min. 
	11.Incubate at 37*C 5%CO2
