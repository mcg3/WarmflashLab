###Receiving Antibodies  

Write the date received, name, and location in the note pad on top shelf of Cecilia's bench.   

If no reconstitution is needed, store as directed.  
If it needs reconstitution, follow the protocol from the company. Adding also the same volume of Glycerol to prevent freezing at -30*.  
Alternativelly, use labeling tape to indicate that it needs reconstitution and store it in the Antibodies Box (after checking that -30 is ok).
