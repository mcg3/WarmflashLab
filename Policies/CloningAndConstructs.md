**Cloning and plasmid policies**  

1. All lab members should have an account with Benchling which should be used to store all plasmid maps and sequences. 
2. Every construct that is cloned should have a corresponding map and sequence on Benchling
3. All cloned constructs should have DNA in the lab box and glycerol stock in the lab box.
